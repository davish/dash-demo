* signups from reps overtime compared to non-rep signups

Again, you can do this however you wish,
though it needs to be in a way that the data can be loaded dynamically--
meaning (for example) that the data should not be hard-coded into the page,
since it will be changing all the time.  Please load the data into the database of your choice.
(Don't load from csvs or any flat files.)

Would be great if you could do this by next week--
When you're done, I'd love to see the live version + all code + any code you used to load / change / adjust the data.
